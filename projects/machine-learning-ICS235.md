summary: "A homework assignment I had for ICS235"
---

This project was an assignment in ICS235 where I used machine learning to seperate and cluster data in an attempt to figure out different cancer types by looking at the gene expression level of a tissue. 

The goal of the assignment was to graph and group the data by their label:

I achieved this result by training a regression neural network with a two-neuron hidden layer in an unsupervised manner. Here's a diagram of what the neural network looks like:

From this project, I learned how to build a simple neural network. This neural network was quite simple as the only hidden layer of the network only had two neurons, but I learned how to build larger and more complex neural network. This project required me to learn how to effieciently read documentation. 

I was the person responsible for this whole project because it was a homework assignment. I did get help from my professor when I was unsure on what to do, but most of the work for this project came from reading documentation and watching Youtube videos when I confused by what I was doing.

Heres a snippet of the code I used:
